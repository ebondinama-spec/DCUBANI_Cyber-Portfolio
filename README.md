# DCUBANI_Cyber-Portfolio
Google Cybersecurity Certificate Portfolio. Showcases defensive and analytical skills: SIEM analysis, Incident Response, Threat Intelligence, and Network Defense. Projects detail risk mitigation using Python, Linux hardening, and industry frameworks (NIST/MITRE ATT&amp;CK).
# 🛡️ Google Cybersecurity Certificate Portfolio

## 🌟 Professional Overview

This repository features a curated portfolio of capstone projects and technical activities completed through the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate program**. The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase practical, job-ready proficiency in core defensive security domains and analytical methodologies.

My work focuses on translating theoretical security concepts into tangible solutions for risk mitigation, incident management, and system hardening.

## 🎯 Key Skill Showcase

This portfolio demonstrates practical application across the following essential cybersecurity domains:

* **SIEM Analysis:** Developing complex queries, building correlation rules, and triaging high-priority alerts within SIEM solutions (e.g., Splunk/Chronicle).
* **Incident Response (IR):** Drafting comprehensive IR playbooks (NIST aligned) for ransomware and phishing incidents, reducing estimated Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR).
* **Network Defense:** Analyzing network traffic (Wireshark) to detect unauthorized lateral movement, identify anomalies, and enforce robust segmentation policies.
* **System Hardening:** Implementing access controls (Least Privilege), configuring firewalls, and hardening Linux environments to meet CIS Benchmarks.
* **Threat Intelligence:** Utilizing OSINT techniques and MITRE ATT&CK to research, analyze, and map emerging threat actor tactics.

## 🛠️ Technical Tools & Frameworks

All projects utilize tools and frameworks relevant to a modern SOC/Security Analyst role:

| Category | Tools/Languages | Frameworks/Standards |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Analysis** | Wireshark, SIEM (Splunk/Chronicle), Nmap | NIST Cybersecurity Framework |
| **Scripting** | **Python**, Bash/Shell Scripting | MITRE ATT&CK |
| **OS/Platforms** | Linux (Ubuntu/Kali), Cloud (AWS/GCP Concepts) | ISO 27001 (Conceptual) |
